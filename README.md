 FSM / ASM Chart Designer - Python Backend

## Project Goal

This backend service takes a description of a Finite State Machine (FSM) or Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) chart, typically generated by a visual frontend tool (like one using Drawflow), processes it, and generates the corresponding VHDL code.

The core workflow is:

1.  Receive the chart structure (as JSON) via an API endpoint.
2.  Parse this JSON into an internal representation of the FSM/ASM.
3.  (Potentially) Reduce the FSM to a state table.
4.  (Potentially) Use libraries like SymPy for logic minimization or analysis.
5.  Generate the equivalent VHDL code describing the state machine.
6.  Return the generated VHDL code (or status/errors) via the API.

## Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Web Framework:** (To be decided - likely FastAPI or Flask) - Handles the API endpoint.
* **Core Logic:** Custom Python code for parsing and state machine logic.
* **Symbolic Math/Logic:** SymPy (for state table reduction, logic minimization - planned).
* **Dependencies:** Managed via `requirements.txt`.

## Project Structure

The backend code is organized as follows:


## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable).
2.  **Navigate to the `server` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```
3.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```
4.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
    * Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
5.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: You'll need to add `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `sympy`, etc., to `requirements.txt` first)*

## Running the Backend Server

(Instructions depend on the chosen framework, e.g., for FastAPI with Uvicorn)

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is active
# Run the server with auto-reload for development
uvicorn main:app --reload
